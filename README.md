The HTML code provided is for creating a simple online learning platform that includes the following main sections:

1. HTML Structure Overview:

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the top of the document indicates that the page is written in HTML5.

The <html lang="en"> tag defines the document as an HTML document with English as the primary language.

The <head> element contains metadata such as the character encoding (UTF-8) and the viewport settings to ensure the page is responsive on mobile devices. It also includes the title of the page, which will be displayed in the browser tab.



2. Head Section:

Inside the <head>, the <meta charset="UTF-8"> ensures that the document uses the UTF-8 character set, allowing the use of various characters and symbols in the text.

The <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> tag allows the page to be responsive on different devices, particularly mobile phones. It ensures that the width of the viewport (the visible area of the web page) matches the width of the device screen and the page zoom level is set to 1.0 (no initial zoom).

The <title> tag sets the text that will appear on the browser tab, which is "Online Learning Platform" in this case.



3. CSS Styling: The style section inside the <head> applies the layout and design of the web page. Here are the main styles used:

Body:

The body of the page uses the Arial, sans-serif font family for the text.

It also sets margin: 0; padding: 0; to remove default margins and padding applied by the browser.

The background color of the body is set to #f9f9f9, which is a light gray color, making the page look clean and simple.


Header:

The header has a background color of #4CAF50, which is a shade of green, with white text (color: white).

The padding of the header is 1rem to give space around the header text, and text-align: center; centers the text horizontally.


Container:

The .container class is applied to the main content area of the page. It adds 2rem of padding to the content, creating space between the content and the edges of the container.


Video Container:

The .video-container section is styled with a bottom margin of 2rem to create space between the video and other elements.

The video element inside the .video-container is styled to be responsive, with width: 100% (taking up the full width of the container) and max-width: 800px (so the video won’t exceed 800px in width).

The video also has rounded corners (border-radius: 10px) and a subtle shadow (box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);) to give it a polished look.


Quiz Section:

The .quiz section contains the quiz and its related elements like the question and the answers.

It has a white background (background: white) and padding of 1rem, along with rounded corners and a shadow for a card-like appearance.

The <h3> tag inside the .quiz section defines the title of the quiz, and there’s a button for submitting the quiz answers.

The button has a background color of green (#4CAF50), which matches the header's color, and a hover effect is implemented to darken the green slightly (background-color: #45a049;) when the user hovers over it.
